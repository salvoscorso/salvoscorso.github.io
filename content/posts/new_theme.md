**Paper it's cool**

The old theme was vintage yes... but this is cooler. His name is [Papermod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) (for the Hugo framework). Take a look! 

Ah! There is also a new section... [the podcast one](https://scors.one/podcasts). I'll post on it all the episodes where I'll go as a speaker. They are all in Italian at the moment. Cheers!

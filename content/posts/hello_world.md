**My first post, in my first finished site... more or less**

I haven't never find time to complete my site, now I did. I will obbligate myself to write only in English, wich is not perfect, to improve it and put myself outside the comfort zone... and yes, I choose this vintage style on purpose, I like it, and it's simple.
At the moment I've not much to say... unless "hello world".
